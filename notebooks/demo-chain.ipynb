    "    Bern, 25.10.2023 - Der Bundesrat hat an seiner Sitzung vom 25.10.2023 das generelle Projekt zur Engpassbeseitigung zwischen der Verzweigung Le Vengeron und dem Anschluss Nyon auf der Autobahn A1 genehmigt. Dank dieser Massnahme kann ein flüssiger und sicherer Verkehrsfluss auf diesem Autobahnabschnitt gewährleistet und die Verkehrsbelastung im nachgelagerten Strassennetz erheblich reduziert werden.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Die geplanten Arbeiten dienen dazu, den Engpass auf der Autobahn A1 zwischen Genf, Coppet und Nyon zu beseitigen. Ausserdem werden dadurch der Verkehrsablauf auf der Kantonsstrasse sowie die Effizienz der Autobahnanschlüsse verbessert. Um den Bedürfnissen des öffentlichen Regionalverkehrs Rechnung zu tragen, werden Bus-Streifen eingerichtet. Ebenfalls vorgesehen sind gesicherte Infrastrukturen für den Langsamverkehr.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Die wichtigsten im generellen Projekt vorgesehenen baulichen Massnahmen sind:\n",
    "\n",
    "    die Verbreiterung der Autobahn auf drei Fahrstreifen pro Fahrtrichtung auf einer Länge von rund 19 Kilometern zwischen der Verzweigung Le Vengeron und dem Anschluss Nyon. Ausserdem wird die Autobahnachse auf einem etwa 2,8 Kilometer langen Abschnitt versetzt, um ein Amphibienlaichgebiet zu erhalten, welches im Inventar der Amphibienlaichgebiete von nationaler Bedeutung verzeichnet ist;\n",
